      <h3>Graphic Design, Web Dev</h3>
      <p>I'm a 16 year old from Cincinnati, Ohio. I currently attend St. Xavier High School, where I am in my Junior year. I like to unleash my creativity by making things. I spend a lot of my time in my school's makerspace working on cool projects, and I am also part of Hack Club, an international non-profit organization that creates communities of makers all over the world and provides support for students who like to create things. Most of my work centers around graphic design and front-end web development (which are my top skills), and I do some other work in Artificial Intelligence development, blockchain, and ethical hacking. I also enjoy traveling. I like getting to see new places, see new things, meet new people, and explore the culture of other parts of the world. I'm a beginner Swedish speaker, I like to collect Ikea Sharks (Bl√•haj Soft Toy), my favorite genre of music is indie (my favorite band is Arcade Fire), and I'm a proud Android user.</p>
